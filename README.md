# Project Overview

This front-end Nanodegree project comprises a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. I completed the test suites required by the course rubric. 

## Instructions

Practice test-driven development with Jasmine by testing the functionality of the feed reader menu and the feeds themselves to ensure that each is unique and loads as expected.
1. start at the top and examine the first test which was done for you. Break it to see how Jasmine shows a failing test, then return it to its passing state. Describe RSS Feeds. Test for properties.
2.  Create a new test suite to check if the menu is hidden by default and toggles visibility. With a separate test for each.
3.  In a new test suite, check the async loadFeed function to see if it loads a single entry and if the next loaded entry is unique.
