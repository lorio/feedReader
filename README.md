# Project Overview

This front-end Nanodegree project comprises a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. I completed the test suites required by the course rubric. 

## Instructions

Practice test-driven development with Jasmine by testing the functionality of the feed reader menu and the feeds themselves to ensure that each is unique and loads as expected.
